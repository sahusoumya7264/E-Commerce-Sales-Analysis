# Dataset Insights
1.Sales Performance
- Category: Data allows segmentation by product category (Furniture, Clothing, Electronics). Each can be analyzed for total sales, profit, and performance against targets. Historically, categories like consumer electronics and fashion drive the largest share of ecommerce sales.
- Profitability: By aggregating profit by category or sub-category, identify most and least profitable product lines. Sub-categories like Phones or Bookcases often surface as top contributors or loss leaders in ecommerce datasets.
  
2. Customer & Geography Analysis
- Key customer insights: Find high-value customers by grouping total spending per customer, identifying loyal shoppers, and potentially targeting them for special offers or loyalty campaigns.
- Regional performance: Aggregating sales by state and city reveals lucrative markets. This can guide inventory and marketing focus, since cities with above-average orders and profit are potential growth areas.

 3. Order & Product Insights
- Order behavior: Average quantity, amount, or profit per order tells about consumer purchasing behavior. Outliers (very high or low orders) can be investigated for fraud, bulk discounts, or special sales.
- Popular sub-categories: Identify which products are repeatedly purchased or generate high total quantity, then use this insight for re-stocking or cross-selling.

4. Targets vs. Actuals
- Target achievement: Compare monthly/category sales to targets to flag periods or segments that underperform, signaling the need for promotional strategies or product improvements.
- Seasonal trends: Monthly breakdowns show seasonalityâ€”when customers buy more, valuable for planning inventory and campaigns.
